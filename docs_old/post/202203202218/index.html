It contains the program code and its activity. Depending on the operating system （OS）, a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.</p></blockquote><p>In computing, a system call （commonly abbreviated to syscall） is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system on which it is executed. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive or accessing the device&#39;s camera), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.</p><p>在计算中，系统调用（通常缩写为syscall）是计算机程序从执行它的操作系统的内核请求服务的编程方式。这可能包括与硬件相关的服务（例如，访问硬盘驱动器或访问设备的摄像头）、新进程的创建和执行以及与集成内核服务（如进程调度）的通信。系统调用提供了进程和操作系统之间的基本接口。</p><h3 id="mechanism-limited-direct-execution">Mechanism: Limited Direct Execution</h3><blockquote><p>本章节讲述系统调用的底层机制（Mechanism）</p></blockquote><p>In order to virtualize the CPU, the operating system needs to somehow share the physical CPU among many jobs running seemingly at the same time. The basic idea is simple: run one process for a little while, then run another one, and so forth. By time sharing the CPU in this manner, virtualization is achieved.</p><p>To make a program run as fast as one might expect, not surprisingly OS developers came up with a technique, which we call limited direct execution.</p><p>This approach gives rise to a few problems in our quest to virtualize the CPU.</p><ul><li>The first is simple: if we just run a program, how can the OS make sure the program doesn’t do anything that we don’t want it to do, while still running it efficiently?</li><li>The second: when we are running a process, how does the operating system stop it from running and switch to another process, thus implementing the time sharing we require to virtualize the CPU?</li></ul><h1 id="disassembly">Disassembly</h1><h2 id="linux">Linux</h2><p>objdump</p><h2 id="gcc">GCC</h2><ul><li>gdb filename</li><li>disas main</li></ul><h1 id="changelog">ChangeLog</h1><p>2022.03.21 12:50 没写多少但还会写下去</p></article></main>
