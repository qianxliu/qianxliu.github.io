<p>Today Let&#39;s talk about &quot;Égalité&quot;(Equality).</p>
<p>In the old times, the <em>Gods</em> are more equal than other animals.</p>
<p>If they commited some crimes, they&#39;re usually punished more lightly than the poors.</p>
<p>The <em>Gods</em> cannot be punished, and <em>Gods&#39; sons</em> cannot be punished.</p>
<p>Just the <em>power</em> breeds corruption.</p>
<p>And the corruption grows, and it becomes the situation that even a devil cannot see.</p>
<p>The fathers&#39; meriths should be credited to the fathers. The sons&#39; evils should be credited to themselves.</p>
<p>If we don&#39;t do that, then we&#39;re raising the devils just borned with the <em>powers</em>.</p>
<p>1、We should not see a <em>God</em>&#39;s soul fallen into a devil.</p>
<p>2、We should not promote this transformation.</p>
<p>With greater ability comes greater responsibility. So we had sought the &quot;Égalité&quot;(Equality).</p>
<p>Because that&#39;s a way to let humans not fallen into devils with undeserved arrogance.</p>
<p>A way to let humans to become what&#39;s themselves.</p>
