I remained silent;
I was not a communist.
When they locked up the social democrats,
I remained silent;
I was not a social democrat.

When they came for the trade unionists,
I did not speak out;
I was not a trade unionist.

When they came for the Jews,
I remained silent;
I was not a Jew.

When they came for me,
there was no one left to speak out.
</code></pre><p>Interesting statements.
Not only for this subject, but for many things.
Individual will is also important.
Nobody can keep being precise, careful and unconcern.
And cowards only learned how to escape.</p>
<p>So we salute for brave, although it may also be blindness, lack of information, even lack of rigor or oral.</p>
<p>Just Because Social Responsibility must exist in a group, not single persons.</p>
