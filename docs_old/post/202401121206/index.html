<pre><code>He often asks himself: 

what is the person he is supposed to be?

If there is no truth, what are we left with?

No guide, no light 

There is only a lonely person, wandering in The boundless universe he has known for a long time.

The memory

The recall

He is also not a person selected as a believer, who is the person he doesn&#x27;t trust;

He is not a person selected as a machine, who is the person he doesn&#x27;t like

The direction

The text

The boundless universe, unknown and choices

He doesn&#x27;t believe everything, just everything

Please keep something in mind, but how to choose them?

The soul of self-awareness

Who is he? What&#x27;s the face under his mask? What&#x27;s his true thought?

What does he want to do, or want to be?

Why does he choose a road that few people walk?

He hates loneliness the most.

But there is only loneliness remaining here. with an endless, self-doubt, dream at midnight.






Why not just admit you just don&#x27;t know yourself, why pretend to be someone who&#x27;s not you

But who are you

Because I have no faults, I have no tears, I never have been in the fear of threat and emotion

I saw the fire. 

No one can read you because you think you know people.

Even you.
