<p>My language is the most different language with English, so English or closer people say it&#39;s hard. Must be hard like the native American languages.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t learn any languages besides Germanic-Latin language family, so they don&#39;t know the languages can be composed in any way.</p>

<p>“The Indigenous languages of the Americas are not all related to each other; instead, they are classified into a hundred or so language families (including a large number of language isolates), as well as a number of extinct languages that are unclassified due to the lack of information on them.” So they don&#39;t ask the viewpoints from the different people.</p>
