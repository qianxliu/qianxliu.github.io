<p>Water can flow smoothly or sourcely.</p>
<h1>Pirate</h1>
<h2>Pirate Civilizations(Sea)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Water can flow smoothly(only themselves), and kill all others(French, Spanish ships by English pirates).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower level of civilization in the beginning of human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nationalism or Extreme Nationalism. Prefer violence. Use A-bombs Firstly. Never regretful/Always hungry actually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report Focus: Some countries oppose me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples: USA and English</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights vs Bartholomew Roberts: &quot;A Merry and Short Life&quot;</p>
<h2>Ascetic Civilizations(Mountain)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Water can flow sourcely(for everyone), and control their people with morality or something.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Higher level of civilization in the beginning of human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Civilized. There is a distinction between elegance and non elegance. Believe in the Mutual morality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report Focus: Some countries like me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples: (Iran), France, (Germany), China</p>
<p>ZhengHe even didn&#39;t build colony in the closest because they can not understand the elegance.</p>
<p>The UK can make a Malaysia. USA can make an Afghanistan, so on.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Old civilizations usually use culture to influence, but modern civilizations use power actually.</p>
<p>Culture means we treat the other people as same as or better than us.</p>
<p>Power simply means the power(Connections, Criminal Groups, Languages, Races, Skin Colors, Money, A-bombs so on).</p>

Portuguese, France are also masters of cultural genocide, we just see the Vietnam, but it's not like the UK, the top of tops.

At least VietNamese is a new language, if it's English place......, the Pirates.
