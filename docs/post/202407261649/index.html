<p>Water can flow smoothly or sourcely.</p>
<h1>Pirate</h1>
<h2>Pirate Civilizations(Sea)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Water can flow smoothly(only themselves), and kill all others(French, Spanish ships by English pirates).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower level of civilization in the beginning of human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nationalism or Extreme Nationalism. Prefer violence. Use A-bombs Firstly. Never regretful/Always hungry actually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report Focus: Some countries oppose me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples: USA and English with 26 Letters.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights vs Bartholomew Roberts: &quot;A Merry and Short Life&quot;</p>
<h2>Ascetic Civilizations(Mountain)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Water can flow sourcely(for everyone), and control their people with morality or something.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Higher level of civilization in the beginning of human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Civilized. There is a distinction between elegance and non elegance. Believe in the Mutual morality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report Focus: Some countries like me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples: (Iran), France, (Germany), China</p>
<p>ZhengHe even didn&#39;t build colony in the closest because they can not understand the elegance.</p>
<p>The UK can make a Malaysia. USA can make an Afghanistan, so on.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Old civilizations usually use culture to influence, but modern civilizations use power actually.</p>
<p>Culture means we treat the other people as same as or better than us.</p>
<p>Power simply means the power(Connections, Criminal Groups, Languages, Races, Skin Colors, Money, A-bombs so on).</p>

Portuguese, France are also masters of cultural genocide, we just see the Vietnam, but it's not like the UK, the top of tops.

At least VietNamese is a new language, if it's English place......, the Pirates.

Not Serious:
For Public: Free Sea > Free/Autocratic Mountain > Autocratic Sea
For Personal: Free Sea > Autocratic Sea > Free/Autocratic Mountain

I only heard the math major in the communism society, never heard the business major.

Most of the chairmen have technical backgrounds, not politics, business, so on.

Business/Politics major > Chemistry/Geology

<p>In USA or some countries, the strangers may shoot you, may rape you, may kill you. With a per capita GDP four times that of China, there are people starving to death on the streets, which is impossible in any EA countries.</p>
<p>In the China, strangers are usually an excellent source and kind signal, Regardless of the skin color.</p>
<p>The glory of United States of America is built on the low caste cleansing. Just like the English with 26 Letters.</p>
<p>The conflicts/wars/injustice of this world actually always relate to English with 26 Letters. It&#39;s the ROOT cause.</p>
