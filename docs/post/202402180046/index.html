<p>“When you finally see them, most people are nice.”</p>
<p>Today Let&#39;s talk about &quot;Maturity&quot;.</p>
<p>Do you have read 《To kill a Mockingbird》? That young child isn&#39;t very mature, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>Because people said the adults usually thinks about problems slower than a children, so they think carefully.</p>
<p>But an adult also can&#39;t really see a problem because they&#39;re surrounded with prides, habits, rules. Illusions. Populism.</p>
<p>So Maturity is only related to what do you use to reason things, and how do you get your reasons.</p>
<p>This is relative not like math; but immaturity is often the root cause of human conflicts.</p>
<p>Maturity should be constructive but not about destroying other ones.
Maturity should be moderate but not aggressive.
Maturity also could be childish but think carefully based on the kind reasons.</p>
<p>For avoiding the illusions of an adult, most of humans need individual thinkings to develop Maturity.
But how to be an individual thinker in a field they don&#39;t really understand?
Which means you need to learn universally and may be uneasy in some totally unfit(not you) fields.</p>
<p>Maturity, is also the mental weights of humans.</p>
<p>(Not everyone will learn math or physics. Next post must be math related.)</p>
