<p>Q: </p>
<p>CHROBOG (GERMANY) SAID WE NEEDED NEW IDEAS ON HOW TO PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY 
OF CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. WE HAD MADE IT CLEAR DURING THE 2+4 
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE WOULD NOT EXTEND NATO BEYOND THE ELBE (SIC) 
. WE COULD NOT 
THEREFORE OFFER MEMBERSHIP OF NATO TO POLAND AND THE OTHERS. WE MIGHT HOWEVER 
CONSIDER REFERRING TO OUR INTEREST IN THESE COUNTRIES IN FUTURE NATO DECLARATIONS. 
FURTHER STEPS COULD BE TAKEN IN THE CSCE 
AND THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENTS.</p>
<p>A from ChatBox:</p>
<pre><code>This text appears to be a 
summary or excerpt from a conversation or statement made by CHROBOG, 
likely a representative or official from Germany, regarding the security
 of Central and Eastern European countries after the end of the Cold 
War.

The key points are:

    CHROBOG acknowledges the need for new ideas on how to provide security for Central and Eastern European countries.
    It is stated that during the &quot;2+4 negotiations&quot; (likely referring to
     the negotiations between the two German states and the four occupying 
    powers after World War II that led to German reunification), it was made
     clear that NATO would not be extended beyond the Elbe River. This 
    implies a commitment not to expand NATO&#x27;s membership to certain 
    countries in the region.
    As a result, Germany cannot offer NATO membership to Poland and other countries in the region.
    However, Germany may consider expressing its interest in these countries in future NATO declarations.
    Further steps to address security concerns in the region could be 
    taken through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
    (CSCE, now known as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
    Europe, OSCE) and through bilateral agreements between countries.

Overall, the text suggests that while Germany is committed to the 
security of Central and Eastern European countries, it is constrained by
 previous commitments not to expand NATO into the region and must 
instead explore other avenues for cooperation and security arrangements.

<p>So English really use their racist energy. Disassembled, puppeted Western Europe and completely exterminated the uncooperative Slavs. But Asians can not be really familiar with the Europe, so the viewpoints also can be wrong.</p>
<hr>
<p>English/USA relies on hypocrisy, while Eurasian countries rely on culture more.</p>
<p>Combating racial discrimination, only includes the blacks, lapdogs who speak English. And actually kills more.</p>
<p>Land without the &quot;roots&quot; is good for the hypocrisy of English. Replace the native with the whites, blacks, lapdogs and then make black people become a minority.</p>
