Q: 

CHROBOG (GERMANY) SAID WE NEEDED NEW IDEAS ON HOW TO PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY 
OF CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. WE HAD MADE IT CLEAR DURING THE 2+4 
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE WOULD NOT EXTEND NATO BEYOND THE ELBE (SIC) 
. WE COULD NOT 
THEREFORE OFFER MEMBERSHIP OF NATO TO POLAND AND THE OTHERS. WE MIGHT HOWEVER 
CONSIDER REFERRING TO OUR INTEREST IN THESE COUNTRIES IN FUTURE NATO DECLARATIONS. 
FURTHER STEPS COULD BE TAKEN IN THE CSCE 
AND THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENTS.

A from ChatBox:

    This text appears to be a 
    summary or excerpt from a conversation or statement made by CHROBOG, 
    likely a representative or official from Germany, regarding the security
     of Central and Eastern European countries after the end of the Cold 
    War.

    The key points are:

        CHROBOG acknowledges the need for new ideas on how to provide security for Central and Eastern European countries.
        It is stated that during the "2+4 negotiations" (likely referring to
         the negotiations between the two German states and the four occupying 
        powers after World War II that led to German reunification), it was made
         clear that NATO would not be extended beyond the Elbe River. This 
        implies a commitment not to expand NATO's membership to certain 
        countries in the region.
        As a result, Germany cannot offer NATO membership to Poland and other countries in the region.
        However, Germany may consider expressing its interest in these countries in future NATO declarations.
        Further steps to address security concerns in the region could be 
        taken through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
        (CSCE, now known as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
        Europe, OSCE) and through bilateral agreements between countries.

    Overall, the text suggests that while Germany is committed to the 
    security of Central and Eastern European countries, it is constrained by
     previous commitments not to expand NATO into the region and must 
    instead explore other avenues for cooperation and security arrangements.

It's probably a thought crime to bring it up anyway, anyway.

So English really use their racist energy. Disassembled, puppeted Western Europe and completely exterminated the uncooperative Slavs. But Asians can not be really familiar with the Europe, so the viewpoints also can be wrong.
