中国, Please carefully translate the NAMES of NATO, TFCMA!

These names probably are decided in the 1900-1945.

<!--

Some countries must have a lot of Chinese immigrants in the before. But now some names must be changed.

Maybe it's also a reflection to show How did 中国 culture pass away.

<!--
So collective governments are right. the best way is totally decoupling.

Although I speak English I should support that.

Enhance the cooperations with Russia, Iran and third world countries with talents but not good names/credits and decouple the relations with the countries with a good name/credit.

They're not good guys, never. Especially ENGLISH. I don't see an ENGLISH who knows Russian, Slavics, Chinese, German or French.

Possible:

Why is English language and some GREAT? Because they contain more biases than other languages.

So it has a good name/credit in other languages, but on the contrary, English doesn't hold this and more hidden, which is learned from French.

That's. Credits.


I also don't see a normal Iranian dislike the US, but on the contrary, an American may dislike Iranian even they don't know them. Many rules follow this.

And, it's not RACISM.
