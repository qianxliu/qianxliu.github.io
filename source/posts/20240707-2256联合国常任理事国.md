Better to kick out the UK, which is an island nation so it can not represent the majority of people. And this world is hard to find a country which is not invaded by English. English don't just touch the Europe, it's a world "police"(bully?) just like the USA.

日本国 is also but Asians are generally more left, and Japanese is a different language not English. And Japan's latitude is closer to that of most countries in the world and it's longer/higher/diverser(which means there're so many kinds of people in Japan), not like the UK. And as an island nation, Japan is closer to the largest ocean. 无论如何，踢出英国加入日本都是更好的选择。

United 한국 is also a better choice, because most Koreans have received higher 教育. And the location of Korea is also very middle in the latitude.

Peaceful Unity of 한국 is almost impossible.

Why did the West and East merge(not by invading)? 

My theory is the peaceful unity can only happen in the German-Latin language familiy, because by any ways, they can be connected by something, which means they will not be isolated by this world.

But the isolations of Asian countries, or Slavic countries, which are the isolations of all of the world. So as long as the isolation continues, the dividions will not change.

Only by war, but it's a cause for the German-Latins. So it's impossible.

So, China should not isolate Russia like the other countries, which is dangerous for this world.

The heaven gives birth to China is to let it be some different.
