Better to kick out the UK, which is an island nation so it can not represent the majority of people.

日本国 is also but Asians are generally more left, and Japanese is a different language not English. And Japan's latitude is closer to that of most countries in the world and it's longer/higher/diverser(which means there're so many kinds of people in Japan), not like the UK.

United 한국 is also a better choice, because most Koreans have received higher education, and they usually are the universal fairer people. And the location of Korea is also very middle in the latitude.
