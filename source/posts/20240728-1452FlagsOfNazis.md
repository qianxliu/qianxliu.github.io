Flags of Nazis share one common feature:

Basically in all of them, there is a figure/absolute midpoint which is symmetrical in center.

So, the flags of the UK, Switzerland, Hrvatska.

And English must also join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which shared the same patterns of Nazi.

And Germany has Marx, others also have the absolute left wingers, the English don't have any famous left wingers at all.
