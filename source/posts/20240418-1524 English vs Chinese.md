# English vs Chinese(quick learning on speaking)

Basics: International Phonetic Alphabet

## Most Different Pronunciations ^[1]


### Consonant Sounds

The keys is the /θ/, /v/

IPA: /θ/, /v/, /l/, /r/

English: think, very, love, red

IPA: /s/, /w/, /l/, /ʐ/

Chinese: si 斯, wai 外, lai 来, ruan

a mistake, /l/ seems like the same :\)^[2]

### Diphthongs(Main)

No: English: /nəʊ/, American: /noʊ/

Chinese: 哦 ou /oʊ/, /əʊ/ doesn't exist.

### Aspirated Consonants(IPAs, not useful for Chinese)

Mandarin Chinese distinguishes between aspirated and 
unaspirated consonants (e.g., "p" vs. "ph", "s" vs "sh"), which is not a feature of English pronunciation.(ChatGPT)

### Random Toughts On (ONLY) Speaking

Not Professional Diffculties/Differences For Chinese: 

(tongue)F(connected speech) > R ~= I ~= (teeth)G ~= E > JS^[3]

For /r//R/ like IPAs:
(tongue) below: F, middle: E/C, above: I

Also, not professional. There, neat comparisons. Linguistics is still difficult, Esperanto probably didn't study Chinese.
