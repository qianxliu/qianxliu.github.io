Parents' sins don't matter to children for the individual.

And hate doesn't let the diverse people united. Love does.

Remember the truths for common goods, but should know different people have their own advantages, and hate can not really change this.

And everyone, is unique. So, Reject categorization and don't be categorizated.

Which is pretty difficult. But people should try to be unique, then can make a difference for a world destined to be ruled by the United States.
