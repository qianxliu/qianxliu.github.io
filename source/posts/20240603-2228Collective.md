# Collective

Remember the truths for common goods, but should know different people have their own advantages, and hate can not really change this.

Reject categorization and don't be categorizated.

Which is pretty difficult. But people should try to be unique, then can really make a difference for the world.

Just like you think the United States is such a democratic country, surely it won’t cooperate with dictatorial countries?
