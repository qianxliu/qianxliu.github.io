# Racism

My language is the most different language with English, so English or closer people say it's hard. Must be hard like the native American languages.

English is so simple for me.

They even don't consider the Korean.

They prefer words starting with J.

They don't learn any languages besides Germanic-Latin language family, so they don't know the languages can be composed in any way.

# Extinct

“The Indigenous languages of the Americas are not all related to each other; instead, they are classified into a hundred or so language families (including a large number of language isolates), as well as a number of extinct languages that are unclassified due to the lack of information on them.”

“From the map of human language families, we can see that the farther civilizations away from UK and are not extinct, which are more possible to be divided by more language families." So they don't ask the viewpoints from the different people.

We also can see Spain and Spanish former colonies are easier to keep more DIFFERENT languages(Basque and so on).
