My language is the most different language with English, so English or closer(Germanic) people say it's hard. Must be hard like the native American languages.

They even don't consider the Korean.

They prefer words starting with J.

They don't learn any languages besides Indo-European language family, so they don't know the languages can be composed in any way.
