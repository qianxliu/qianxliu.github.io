# Lonely

```
He often asks himself: 

what is the person he is supposed to be?

If there is no truth, what are we left with?

No guide, no light 

There is only a lonely person, wandering in The boundless universe he has known for a long time.

The memory

The recall

He is also not a person selected as a believer, who is the person he doesn't trust;

He is not a person selected as a machine, who is the person he doesn't like

The direction

The text

The boundless universe, unknown and choices

He doesn't believe everything, just everything

Please keep something in mind, but how to choose them?

The soul of self-awareness

Who is he? What's the face under his mask? What's his true thought?

What does he want to do, or want to be?

Why does he choose a road that few people walk?

He hates loneliness the most.

But there is only loneliness remaining here. with an endless, self-doubt, dream at midnight.






Why not just admit you just don't know yourself, why pretend to be someone who's not you

But who are you

Because I have no faults, I have no tears, I never have been in the fear of threat and emotion

I saw the fire. 

No one can read you because you think you know people.

Even you.
