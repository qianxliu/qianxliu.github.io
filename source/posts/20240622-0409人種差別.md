# 人種差別/인종 차별

My language is the most different language with English, so English or closer people say it's hard. Must be hard like the native American languages.

English is so simple for me.

They even don't consider the Korean.

They prefer words starting with J.

They don't learn any languages besides Germanic-Latin language family, so they don't know the languages can be composed in any way.

# Extinct

“The Indigenous languages of the Americas are not all related to each other; instead, they are classified into a hundred or so language families (including a large number of language isolates), as well as a number of extinct languages that are unclassified due to the lack of information on them.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas

From the map of human language families, we can see that the farther civilizations away from UK and are not extinct, which are more possible to be divided by more language families. So they don't ask the viewpoints from the different native people(After all, due to survivor bias, linguists are centered at UK. Or nobody dies from hunger, because they don't talk and surf the internet).

We also can see Spain and Spanish former colonies are easier to keep more DIFFERENT languages(Basque and so on).

<!--
A real language familiy centered at Asia, should be now at least Turkic language familiy + CJK + SEA + Middle East, North Africa, part of Slavic language familiy + India, Persian even Latin. But it's, eh, humanity subject.
I can't see any similarities between Persian and English at all.

Persian is very similar with Chinese in grammars and so on. RTL is used in the ancient CJK, and ancient CJK doesn't have gender(and Hungarian, Finnish). 彼/彼女

# Wonder

"The Newark Earthworks in Newark and Heath, Ohio, consist of three sections of preserved earthworks: the Great Circle Earthworks, the Octagon Earthworks, and the Wright Earthworks. This complex, built by the Hopewell culture between 100 BCE and 400 CE, contains the largest earthen enclosures in the world, and was about 3,000 acres in total extent. Less than 10 percent of the total site has been preserved since European-American settlement; this area contains a total of 206 acres (83 ha).", "In 1982 researchers from Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana concluded that the complex was a lunar observatory, designed to track motions of the moon, including the northernmost point of the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar orbit."
