# Maturity

“When you finally see them, most people are nice.”

Today Let's talk about "Maturity".

Do you have read 《To kill a Mockingbird》? That young child isn't very mature, isn't it?

Because people said the adults usually thinks about problems slower than a children, so they think carefully.

But an adult also can't really see a problem because they're surrounded with prides, habits, rules. Illusions. Populism.

So Maturity is only related to what do you use to reason things, and how do you get your reasons.

This is relative not like math; but immaturity is often the root cause of human conflicts.

Maturity should be constructive but not about destroying other ones.
Maturity should be moderate but not aggressive.
Maturity also could be childish but think carefully based on the kind reasons.

For avoiding the illusions of an adult, most of humans need individual thinkings to develop Maturity.
But how to be an individual thinker in a field they don't really understand?
Which means you need to learn universally and may be uneasy in some totally unfit(not you) fields.

Maturity, is also the mental weights of humans.

(Not everyone will learn math or physics. Next post must be math related.)
