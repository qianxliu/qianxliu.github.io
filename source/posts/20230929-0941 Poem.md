In the tapestry of time's gentle weave,
Moon ascends, its light does cleave,
Stars shine bright, as dreams believe,
Tales of youth, that the night will retrieve.

The hands of time, in light's soft glow,
Guide the dreams where youthful memories flow,
Moments of passion, of joy, of woe,
All beneath the moon's watchful show.

Dreams of youth, in radiant light,
Shimmer and dance, taking their flight,
Chasing the moon, through the vastness of night,
Bound by time, yet shining so bright.

So when daylight fades, and twilight's in sight,
Turn to the moon, with its beacon of light,
For in its glow, dreams and time unite,
Celebrating youth, in the heart of the night.
