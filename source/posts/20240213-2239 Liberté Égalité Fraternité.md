# Liberté Égalité Fraternité

Today Let's talk about "Égalité"(Equality).

In the old times, the *Gods* are more equal than other animals.

If they commited some crimes, they're usually punished more lightly than the poors.

The *Gods* cannot be punished, and *Gods' sons* cannot be punished.

Just the *power* breeds corruption.

And the corruption grows, and it becomes the situation that even a devil cannot see.

The fathers' meriths should be credited to the fathers. The sons' evils should be credited to themselves.

If we don't do that, then we're raising the devils just borned with the *powers*.

1、We should not see a *God*'s soul fallen into a devil.

2、We should not promote this transformation.

With greater ability comes greater responsibility. So we had sought the "Égalité"(Equality).

Because that's a way to let humans not fallen into devils with undeserved arrogance.

A way to let humans to become what's themselves.
