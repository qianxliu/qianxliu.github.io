> Base text is mainly English+Chinese+French+others, because Fraternity has two meanings in English such as brotherhood(shared with most Germanic/Slavic/Latin), so may the translations be not such completed in the first because such as in Japanese/Chinese/Korean, universal love is a single word different with the brotherhood.

> Philanthropy: The desire to promote the welfare of others, expressed especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. Usually in Germanics.

> English(G): English(G) usually places the brotherhood meaning as the first.
