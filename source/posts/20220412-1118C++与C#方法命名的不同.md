# C++与C#方法命名的不同

## C#的命名规范

- ✔️ DO use PascalCasing for all public member, type, and namespace names consisting of multiple words.
- ✔️ DO use camelCasing for parameter names.
- ❌ DO NOT capitalize each word in so-called closed-form compound words.
- ❌ DO NOT assume that all programming languages are case sensitive. They are not. Names cannot differ by case alone.

据说C#变量命名有其历史原因。
